    <p><em>Hello and Welcome to <strong>AmLpStudio</strong>!
 We are an arts organization and we want to support you and your mental stability by healing it through art. For us, the most important part is to create art that represents that specific type of age issue, the struggle that a person can go through, and bring you peace of mind, of belonging as a person, as a part of this world. AmLpStudio stands for Amy Life Portfolio, but the CEO/Founder decided to turn it into a new generation art movement! We believe we are the next Art World! We believe in you and your wellness and we would like to help you achieve it, to inspire you to reach that level of comfort and happiness!
